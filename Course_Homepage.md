Learn how to analyse, assess, and interpret MAVE data for clinical and research applications 

### Summary

Multiplex assays of variant effects (MAVEs) are a series of high throughput experimental methods used to interrogate the phenotypic or functional effects of thousands of genetic variants in parallel. They have rapidly increased our ability to assess variants of uncertain significance (VUS) where rare or unknown variants may be responsible for pathogenic disease-associated effects. Their recent adoption into clinical diagnostics provides additional evidence for variant interpretation and translation.
